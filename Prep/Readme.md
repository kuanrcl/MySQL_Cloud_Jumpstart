# Set up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Basic

Create a compartment to organize your OCI resources

The MySQL server is up and running at the OCI compute instance, we will use MySQL Workbench to navigate the the database engine:
1. Engine Status
2. Engine Dashboard
3. Engine Log

## Engine Status (is it running? how much is the CPU utilization, etc)

There are 2 tabs in the **Navigator** panel of the Workbench (you can alternate the 2 different views by clicking the arrow to change the view)

* **Administration**
* Schemas
